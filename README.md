Please Note that functionality from this repo is currently integrated into the official [HoloToolkit for Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/).

# HoloUI
The goal of this project is to provide UI experiences as close as possible to the default Hololens-Applications/Main Screen. 
It should be as easy to use as possible, as a thin layer ontop of the [HoloToolkit for Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/) and the default Unity functions.
It helps creating dynamic applications in VR/AR with tools like a dynamic ButtonGroup.
